# Adventure-Works

## Prject Overview
The management team needs a way to track KPIs(sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

All that I have been given was a folder of raw csv files, which contains information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.


## The Objective
Use Power BI Desktop to:
- Connect and transform the raw data
- Build a relational data model
- Create calculated columns and measures with DAX
- Desgin an interactive dashboard to visualize the data
